# Shift schedule
The first part of the website helps shift workers calculate their overtime 
payment amount. 

The second part helps create your monthly schedule by getting your duty on any particular day of the week. 
Eg 3/7/2022 D1 (Day 1) or O1 (Off duty 1)

You can further create your time sheet correction. 

This project is tailored to a specific company, but can be modified to suit your needs.
